### CPSC120

* Lab 1 

Lab 1 was one of my favorites, it was my first time learning how to code. With this lab, I was able to learn how to declare std::cout and make the output execute "Hello Jett!"

* Lab 5

Lab 5, part 2 was one of my favorites. It provides functions to determine the type of card, calculate points for individual cards, check for a bust, and finally compute the score for the hand. I was able to write functions that computes how many cards you have on your hand and the value it has just like playing blackjack normally.

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorites. The program utilizes the arithmetic mean formula to compute the average accurately, using floating-point arithmetic to handle decimal values. I was able to understand how to use the if(arguments.size) so that the program knows what do I need to input.
